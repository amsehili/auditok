Load audio data
---------------

Audio data is loaded using the :func:`load` function, which can read from
audio files, capture from the microphone, or accept raw audio data
(as a ``bytes`` object).

From a file
===========

If the first argument of :func:`load` is a string or a ``Path``, it should
refer to an existing audio file.

.. code:: python

    import auditok
    region = auditok.load("audio.ogg")

If the input file contains raw (headerless) audio data, specifying audio
parameters (``sampling_rate``, ``sample_width``, and ``channels``) is required.
Additionally, if the file name does not end with 'raw', you should explicitly
pass ``audio_format="raw"`` to the function.

In the example below, we provide audio parameters using their abbreviated names:

.. code:: python

    region = auditok.load("audio.dat",
                          audio_format="raw",
                          sr=44100, # alias for `sampling_rate`
                          sw=2,      # alias for `sample_width`
                          ch=1      # alias for `channels`
                          )

Alternatively you can user :class:`AudioRegion` to load audio data:

.. code:: python

    from auditok import AudioRegion
    region = AudioRegion.load("audio.dat",
                              audio_format="raw",
                              sr=44100, # alias for `sampling_rate`
                              sw=2,     # alias for `sample_width`
                              ch=1      # alias for `channels`
                              )


From a ``bytes`` object
=======================

If the first argument is of type ``bytes``, it is interpreted as raw audio data:

.. code:: python

    sr = 16000
    sw = 2
    ch = 1
    data = b"\0" * sr * sw * ch
    region = auditok.load(data, sr=sr, sw=sw, ch=ch)
    print(region)
    # alternatively you can use
    region = auditok.AudioRegion(data, sr, sw, ch)

output:

.. code:: bash

    AudioRegion(duration=1.000, sampling_rate=16000, sample_width=2, channels=1)

From the microphone
===================

If the first argument is ``None``, :func:`load` will attempt to read data from the
microphone. In this case, audio parameters, along with the ``max_read`` parameter,
are required.

.. code:: python

    sr = 16000
    sw = 2
    ch = 1
    five_sec_audio = load(None, sr=sr, sw=sw, ch=ch, max_read=5)
    print(five_sec_audio)

output:

.. code:: bash

    AudioRegion(duration=5.000, sampling_rate=16000, sample_width=2, channels=1)


Skip part of audio data
=======================

If the ``skip`` parameter is greater than 0, :func:`load` will skip that specified
amount of leading audio data, measured in seconds:

.. code:: python

    import auditok
    region = auditok.load("audio.ogg", skip=2) # skip the first 2 seconds

This argument must be 0 when reading data from the microphone.


Limit the amount of read audio
==============================

If the ``max_read`` parameter is > 0, :func:`load` will read at most that amount
in seconds of audio data:

.. code:: python

    import auditok
    region = auditok.load("audio.ogg", max_read=5)
    assert region.duration <= 5

This argument is required when reading data from the microphone.


Basic split example
-------------------

In the following example, we'll use the :func:`split` function to tokenize an
audio file.Weâ€™ll specify that valid audio events must be at least 0.2 seconds
long, no longer than 4 seconds, and contain no more than 0.3 seconds of continuous
silence. By setting a 4-second limit, an event lasting 9.5 seconds, for instance,
will be returned as two 4-second events plus a final 1.5-second event. Additionally,
a valid event may contain multiple silences, as long as none exceed 0.3 seconds.

:func:`split` returns a generator of :class:`AudioRegion` objects. Each
:class:`AudioRegion` can be played, saved, repeated (multiplied by an integer),
and concatenated with another region (see examples below). Note that
:class:`AudioRegion` objects returned by :func:`split` include ``start`` and ``stop``
attributes, which mark the beginning and end of the audio event relative to the
input audio stream.

.. code:: python

    import auditok

    # `split` returns a generator of AudioRegion objects
    audio_events = auditok.split(
        "audio.wav",
        min_dur=0.2,     # Minimum duration of a valid audio event in seconds
        max_dur=4,       # Maximum duration of an event
        max_silence=0.3, # Maximum tolerated silence duration within an event
        energy_threshold=55 # Detection threshold
    )

    for i, r in enumerate(audio_events):
        # AudioRegions returned by `split` have defined 'start' and 'end' attributes
        print(f"Event {i}: {r.start:.3f}s -- {r.end:.3f}")

        # Play the audio event
        r.play(progress_bar=True)

        # Save the event with start and end times in the filename
        filename = r.save("event_{start:.3f}-{end:.3f}.wav")
        print(f"event saved as: {filename}")

Example output:

.. code:: bash

    Event 0: 0.700s -- 1.400s
    event saved as: event_0.700-1.400.wav
    Event 1: 3.800s -- 4.500s
    event saved as: event_3.800-4.500.wav
    Event 2: 8.750s -- 9.950s
    event saved as: event_8.750-9.950.wav
    Event 3: 11.700s -- 12.400s
    event saved as: event_11.700-12.400.wav
    Event 4: 15.050s -- 15.850s
    event saved as: event_15.050-15.850.wav

Split and plot
--------------

Visualize audio signal and detections:

.. code:: python

    import auditok
    region = auditok.load("audio.wav") # returns an AudioRegion object
    regions = region.split_and_plot(...) # or just region.splitp()

output figure:

.. image:: figures/example_1.png

Split an audio stream and re-join (glue) audio events with silence
------------------------------------------------------------------

The following code detects audio events within an audio stream, then insert
1 second of silence between them to create an audio with pauses:

.. code:: python

    # Create a 1-second silent audio region
    # Audio parameters must match the original stream
    from auditok import split, make_silence
    silence = make_silence(duration=1,
                           sampling_rate=16000,
                           sample_width=2,
                           channels=1)
    events = split("audio.wav")
    audio_with_pauses = silence.join(events)

Alternatively, use ``split_and_join_with_silence``:

.. code:: python

    from auditok import split_and_join_with_silence
    audio_with_pauses = split_and_join_with_silence(silence_duration=1, input="audio.wav")


Read audio data from the microphone and perform real-time event detection
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

If the first argument of :func:`split` is ``None``, audio data is read from the
microphone (requires `pyaudio <https://people.csail.mit.edu/hubert/pyaudio>`_):

.. code:: python

    import auditok

    sr = 16000
    sw = 2
    ch = 1
    eth = 55 # alias for energy_threshold, default value is 50

    try:
        for region in auditok.split(input=None, sr=sr, sw=sw, ch=ch, eth=eth):
            print(region)
            region.play(progress_bar=True) # progress bar requires `tqdm`
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
         pass


:func:`split` will continue reading audio data until you press ``Ctrl-C``. To read
a specific amount of audio data, pass the desired number of seconds using the
``max_read`` argument.


Access recorded data after split
--------------------------------

Using a :class:`Recorder` object you can access to audio data read from a file
of from the mirophone. With the following code press ``Ctrl-C`` to stop recording:


.. code:: python

    import auditok

    sr = 16000
    sw = 2
    ch = 1
    eth = 55 # alias for energy_threshold, default value is 50

    rec = auditok.Recorder(input=None, sr=sr, sw=sw, ch=ch)
    events = []

    try:
        for region in auditok.split(rec, sr=sr, sw=sw, ch=ch, eth=eth):
            print(region)
            region.play(progress_bar=True)
            events.append(region)
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
         pass

    rec.rewind()
    full_audio = auditok.load(rec.data, sr=sr, sw=sw, ch=ch)
    # alternatively you can use
    full_audio = auditok.AudioRegion(rec.data, sr, sw, ch)
    full_audio.play(progress_bar=True)


:class:`Recorder` also accepts a ``max_read`` argument.

Working with AudioRegions
-------------------------

In the following sections, we will review several operations
that can be performed with :class:`AudioRegion` objects.

Basic region information
========================

.. code:: python

    import auditok
    region = auditok.load("audio.wav")
    len(region) # number of audio samples int the regions, one channel considered
    region.duration # duration in seconds
    region.sampling_rate # alias `sr`
    region.sample_width # alias `sw`
    region.channels # alias `ch`

When an audio region is returned by the :func:`split` function, it includes defined
``start`` and ``end`` attributes that refer to the beginning and end of the audio
event relative to the input audio stream.

Concatenate regions
===================

.. code:: python

    import auditok
    region_1 = auditok.load("audio_1.wav")
    region_2 = auditok.load("audio_2.wav")
    region_3 = region_1 + region_2

This is particularly useful when you want to join regions returned by the
:func:`split` function:

.. code:: python

    import auditok
    regions = auditok.load("audio.wav").split()
    gapless_region = sum(regions)

Repeat a region
===============

Multiply by a positive integer:

.. code:: python

    import auditok
    region = auditok.load("audio.wav")
    region_x3 = region * 3

Split one region into N regions of equal size
=============================================

Divide by a positive integer (this is unrelated to silence-based tokenization!):

.. code:: python

    import auditok
    region = auditok.load("audio.wav")
    regions = regions / 5
    assert sum(regions) == region

Note that if an exact split is not possible, the last region may be shorter
than the preceding N-1 regions.

Slice a region by samples, seconds or milliseconds
==================================================

Slicing an :class:`AudioRegion` can be useful in various situations.
For example, you can remove a fixed-length portion of audio data from
the beginning or end of a region, or crop a region by an arbitrary amount
as a data augmentation strategy.

The most accurate way to slice an :class:`AudioRegion` is by using indices
that directly refer to raw audio samples. In the following example, assuming
the audio data has a sampling rate of 16000, you can extract a 5-second
segment from the main region, starting at the 20th second, as follows:

.. code:: python

    import auditok
    region = auditok.load("audio.wav")
    start = 20 * 16000
    stop = 25 * 16000
    five_second_region = region[start:stop]

This allows you to start and stop at any audio sample within the region. Similar
to a ``list``, you can omit either ``start`` or ``stop``, or both. Negative
indices are also supported:

.. code:: python

    import auditok
    region = auditok.load("audio.wav")
    start = -3 * region.sr # `sr` is an alias of `sampling_rate`
    three_last_seconds = region[start:]

While slicing by raw samples offers flexibility, using temporal indices is
often more intuitive. You can achieve this by accessing the ``millis`` or ``seconds``
*views* of an :class:`AudioRegion` (or using their shortcut aliases ``ms``, ``sec``, or ``s``).

With the ``millis`` view:

.. code:: python

    import auditok
    region = auditok.load("audio.wav")
    five_second_region = region.millis[5000:10000]
    # or
    five_second_region = region.ms[5000:10000]

or with the ``seconds`` view:

.. code:: python

    import auditok
    region = auditok.load("audio.wav")
    five_second_region = region.seconds[5:10]
    # or
    five_second_region = region.sec[5:10]
    # or
    five_second_region = region.s[5:10]

``seconds`` indices can also be floats:

.. code:: python

    import auditok
    region = auditok.load("audio.wav")
    five_second_region = region.seconds[2.5:7.5]

Export an ``AudioRegion`` as a ``numpy`` array
==============================================

.. code:: python

    from auditok import load, AudioRegion
    audio = load("audio.wav") # or use `AudioRegion.load("audio.wav")`
    x = audio.numpy()
    assert x.shape[0] == audio.channels
    assert x.shape[1] == len(audio)
